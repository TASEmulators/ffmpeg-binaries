ffmpeg binaries, so we don't lose them

# 20181118-529debc
Required by some bizhawk versions

# 4.4.1
Linux build is taken from https://www.johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/old-releases/ffmpeg-4.4.1-amd64-static.tar.xz 

Windows build is taken from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/packages/ffmpeg-4.4.1-essentials_build.7z

Recompressed to `.7z` until SharpCompress supports `.tar.xz`, also everything but `ffmpeg` is removed to reduce file size.
